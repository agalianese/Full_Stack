# Full_Stack
This repository comprises some of examples of my Full Stack Development. 

### MonsterSighting
Monster Sighting is a Spring Boot Full Stack Monster Sighting App using Thymeleaf to connect backend and frontend. The backend connects to an SQL script that keeps track of monster, location, sighting, organization, and power information. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete entries.It also allows users to record sightings for a particular time and data, view monsters according to the organizations they belong to, locations they have been seen at, and view all monsters that belong to a particular organization.


### Hangman
